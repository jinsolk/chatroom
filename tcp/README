/**
	The UDP and TCP servers are simply echo servers i.e. when a client sends a
	string to the server, the server simply replies back with the string. The
	main purpose of these programs is to illustrate the Java Libraries used to
	start UDP and TCP connections. 

	To use UDPServer.java and UDPClient.java to run and test UDP connections,
	perform the following steps:

	(1) Compile both java files. For example, from the command-line, type 
	    javac UDPServer.java. This produces the corresponding class file (such 
	    as UDPServer.class). If you import the java files into an IDE such as 
            Eclipse, you can skip this step since the IDE takes care of compiling 
            the files before running them.
	
        (2) Run the Server. For example, from the command-line, type java UDPServer.
	    The IP address of the Server is assumed to be your local machine and the
	    port number is pre-defined as 6700.
   
        (3) Run the Client with arguments "String" "Server's hostname". From the 
	    command-line type: java UDPClient hello localhost.

	Similarly, you can follow steps 1 through 3 to run TCPServer.java & TCPClient.java
